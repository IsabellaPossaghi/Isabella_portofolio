    <p>The year was 1996, the 10th February,
      and the world was waiting for the clash of the century:
      Kasparov against the supercomputer <i>Deep Blue</i>.<br>
      IBM, at that time, was the strongest and largest computer company,
      that released a hellish machine capable - according to the creators
      of beating World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov.<br><br>
      The computer managed to hinder the great master’s plans during six grueling matches,
      thus marking a decisive historical event: <br>
      the first time one of the greatest human intelligences had lost to a machine in a chess game.

    <p>For my data visualization I took into consideration not only every move that Kasparov and Deep Blue have done,<br>
      but the entire strategy, in order to map the entire match’s dynamics. Gerry Kasparov’s mind status and emotions have also been visualized.<br>
      The metaphor that I decided to mantain as main elements the board and its pieces,
      no other figurative lement is introduced. I wanted to keep the game scenario,
      without detaching from the place where Kasparov projects his thoughts and emotions.

  <div class="main">
    <p>To express the concept I focussed on the elements’ appearance,
      like applying alteration of some details, up to the distortion of the entire game table.<br><br>
      You can follow the game’s course, through the progressive mutation of the game scenario
      throughout the whole thing. This not only refers to the growing anxiety and frustration,
      but also to the emotional balance recovered every time the champion manages to control the game again.</p>

    <p><i>Is it possible for a machine to imagine?</i><br>
      The most nervous and indecisive moments have been caused by the supercomputer’s glitches.
      Deep Blue definitely did not generate the output expected by IBM engineers,
      but could it be really definable as a simple disruption?<br><br>
      Maybe the object had worked out a brilliant solution, even better than the one predicted by its creators.
      These precise events staggered the Grand Master’s confidence,
      who had considered them <i>"too human"</i> to be played by a machine.</p>
